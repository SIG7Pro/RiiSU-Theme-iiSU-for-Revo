These are the images used in the theme.
Most graphics are edited versions of Revo graphics or graphics from iiSU Interpreted (an iiSU theme for ES-DE, primarily the old version of the theme.)

The folder called "RiiSU_iiSUTheme Loop" is my attempt at making the [iiSU Complete Theme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tXiZQnPcfg) loop perfectly for use in Revo Launcher. Works mostly like a charm. Sure you could have it loop regularly, but then the intro of it and the outro/fade-away would be jarring.

Lots of graphics listed under channel_[...].png are early versions of trying to get the channels to look right, and then finding out I couldn't clip them over transparent parts of an image + the grain one had a weird error too.

Empty Space (non-transparent) was me tryna get the thing to look as iiSU as I could get it to be, but the channel borders surrounded the empty channels too, and it kinda bummed me out.

Experiment.png was me finding out that Revo Launcher stretches the wallpaper image in themes too, so I tried to make something that would fit on both screen sizes. Also done for the Settings Background.

Home Menu Template.psd is my attempt at seeing what works when replicating how the iiSU Home Menu looks like.
